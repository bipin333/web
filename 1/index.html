When Naruto was just a newborn, the nine-tailed fox, a powerful and destructive creature, attacked his village and caused widespread destruction. In order to protect the village from the fox's rampage, the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, sealed the fox within Naruto. This act saved the village but also left Naruto ostracized and mistreated by the other villagers, who were afraid of the fox's power and blamed Naruto for the tragedy. Despite this, Naruto was determined to become a ninja and prove to the village that he was not the monster they thought he was.

Throughout his journey as a ninja, Naruto faced many challenges and struggles. He was often underestimated by his peers and looked down upon by the older generation of ninja because of the fox sealed within him. However, Naruto never let this discourage him and always pushed forward with determination and perseverance. He also had a natural talent for ninja techniques and was able to learn and master many powerful skills and abilities.
